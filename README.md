Summary:
1. Both citites have a wide range of offers to choose from, but in general, Athens seems like a better option if you are on a budget.
2. If you donâ€™t like crowds and you can wait for occupation to drop, the first trimester of the year seems like your best option. 
3. Prices can vary significantly depending on which neighbourhood you choose.
