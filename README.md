# A data based approach using Airbnb public data
Athens vs Barcelona 
-----------------------------------
Libraries:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib.pyplot

Motivation:
This project was inspired on the public data published by Airbnb. I thought it was interesting to compare prices and the seasonal behavoir between cities and neighbourhoods.

My analysis is based on 3 main questions:

1. How do prices compare between cities?
2. Is there a seasonal trend for demand?
3. Are prices the same for each neighbourhood?

Summary:
1. Both citites have a wide range of offers to choose from, but in general, Athens seems like a better option if you are on a budget.
2. If you donâ€™t like crowds and you can wait for occupation to drop, the first trimester of the year seems like your best option. 
3. Prices can vary significantly depending on which neighbourhood you choose.
